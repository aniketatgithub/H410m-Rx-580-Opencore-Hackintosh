All ports and Apple services such as iMessage, FaceTime, and the App Store function flawlessly. However, it's crucial to change the Serial Number in the Plist to avoid potential issues with your Apple ID being blocked. You can generate a serial number through SM-BIOS, and for editing the Plist, use Proper Tree (Download link provided at the bottom).

*While I couldn't successfully enable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, the Ethernet port works smoothly, allowing for audio streaming from applications to your phone and then to earphones.* To resolve this, simply copy the necessary kexts to your kext folder inside the OS directory.


Well Finally you can game in MAC OS:)

You have the option to perform a dual boot with this operating system alongside Windows. The steps remain unchanged; just select Opencore in the boot menu and install macOS on a drive without Windows installed. Using an SSD for the installation will provide a smoother experience.
